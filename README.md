About
=====

<http://WhatTheFuckShouldIBeForHalloween.com> is a rip off of
<http://WhatTheFuckShouldIMakeForDinner.com>. Each reload of
the site serves up a random absurd sexy Halloween costume idea.

I've written a blog post about it:
<http://blog.classicalcode.com/2013/10/whatthefuckshouldibeforhalloween-com/>

Contribute
==========

The site mostly consists of the following lists:

1. **Prompts**: Rude ways of suggesting a costume. Must include the word "fuck"
   in some form.
2. **Adjectives**: Synonyms for sexy. Must be real words.
3. **Nouns**: Funny nouns. Ideally the noun will not be funny or sexual on it's
   own. People/professions are off limits as they result in less absurd
   results.
4. **Nexts**: Phrases the user might use to reject the current suggestion. Not
   profane.  Written from the user's point of view.

They can be found inline in `index.html`. If you would like to suggest some
additional options for these lists, or any other features, please send a pull
request.
